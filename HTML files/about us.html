	<p><h6><u>Our Company</u> <br> <br> <br>
	To say Starbucks purchases and roasts high-quality whole bean coffees is very true.
	That’s the essence of what we do – but it hardly tells the whole story. <br> <br>
	Our coffeehouses have become a beacon for coffee lovers everywhere. Why do they insist on Starbucks? 
	Because they know they can count on genuine service, an inviting atmosphere and a superb 
	cup of expertly roasted and richly brewed coffee every time. <br> <br> <br> <br>

	<u>Expect More Than Coffee</u> <br> <br> <br>
	We are passionate purveyors of coffee and everything else that goes with a rewarding coffeehouse experience. 
	We also offer a selection of premium Tazo® teas, fine pastries and other delectable treats to please the taste buds. 
	And the music you hear in store is chosen for its artistry and appeal. People come to Starbucks to chat, meet up or work. <br> <br>

	We’re a neighborhood gathering place, a part of the daily routine – and we couldn’t be happier about it. 
	Get to know us and you’ll see: we are so much more than what we brew. <br> <br> <br> <br>
