		<font color="white">

		<p><h6>The Starbucks company was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon 
		Bowker at Seattle's Pike Place Market. During the early 1980s, they sold the 
		company to Howard Schultz who – after a business trip to Milan, Italy – 
		decided to make the coffee bean store a coffeeshop serving espresso-based drinks. 
		Schultz's first tenure as chief executive, from 1986 to 2000, led to an aggressive 
		expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the U.S. West Coast. 
		Despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the Midwest and 
		British Columbia, the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry 
		into California in the early 1990s through a series of highly publicized coffee wars. 
		Schultz was succeeded by Orin Smith who ran the company for five years, positioning 
		Starbucks as a large player in fair trade coffee and increasing sales to $5 billion. 
		Jim Donald served as chief executive from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a 
		large-scale earnings expansion. Schultz returned as CEO in the middle of the 2008 
		financial crisis and spent the succeeding decade growing its market share, 
		expanding its offerings, and reorienting itself around corporate social responsibility. 
		Kevin Johnson took over from Schultz in 2017, and continues to serve as the firm's chief executive. </p></h6>
